# BEW2.1 Assignment 2: Serverless Challenge

This serverless app follows the [Serverless guide](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-express-rest-api) to deploying serverless functions on AWS Lambda.

Note: `sls offline start` helps speedy up development by providing a local environment for debugging before deployment. Don't forget to run `sls dynamodb install` for this to work.
